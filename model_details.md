# Purpose of this document

This document is intended to describe both the underlying equations of motion for `SkellySim`, as well as the actual
implementation to solve those equations. For new and old developers of SkellySim (and its predecessors), this document
should be the goto place for the technical underpinnings of `SkellySim`. This is not for describing flags, variables, or
more fine-grained implementation details, but should be more for a birds-eye view of how the package works. For those
kinds of details, the user and developer documentation are better places to focus. This document should aim to avoid
having to consult the source code to figure out the whats, whys, and whens of the math being done. This can be
overwhelming and error prone.
