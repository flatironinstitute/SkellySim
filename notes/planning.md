# Issues
1. Close Eval (for surfaces)
2. Close Eval (for fibers) ???
3. Fiber Discretization
4. Fictitious ??? motion caused by ??? (timestepping scheme)
5. Boundary condition types (on fiber, on fluid)
6. Integration for different timestepping schemes
7. Do we have background flows?
8. Better scheme for bodies (stability)
9. Better for system for initial condition perturbation
10. Other formulations (Donev/Maxian/Ohm/Tangent-angle type formulation)
11. Stealth swimmers
12. Motors !?!?!&$@$
13. Background flows

# Test problems:
1. PDE solver tests for exterior confinement // mobile bodies in confinement
    * easy for exterior; probably easy enough for exterior/interior
    * refinement for harder problems
    * robert has done approaching a periphery but not rotating
2. Single fiber refinement studies (correct accuracy in space / time)
    * free fibers
    * clamped fibers
    * pinned & growing fibers
3. Many fiber refinement studies
    * body with interacting fibers
    * ... lots of things we can imagine
4. Things with known solutions ---
    * single fiber under load (oscillation frequency /-> RFT)
    * ehssans oscillatory rheology computations
    * slow rotation with single MT on body (asymptotic calculation)
5. Stress tests
    * fibers aligned along extensional / compressional / shear flows
    * Reza's example
