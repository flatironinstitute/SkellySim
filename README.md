# SkellySim
SkellySim is a simulation package for simulating cellular components such as flexible filaments, motor proteins, and arbitrary rigid bodies.
It's designed to be highly scalable, capable of both OpenMP and MPI style parallelism, while using the efficient STKFMM/PVFMM libraries for hydrodynamic resolution.
