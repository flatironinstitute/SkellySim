Not the most useful test, but interesting. Drag/velocity of a fiber with constant force/length
inside of a spherical periphery should be independent of position, which SkellySim supports.

```
% ./calc_velocity.py
theoretical drag: 0.9177395848298898
measured drag: 0.9177395848290841
relative error: 8.778533455711113e-13
